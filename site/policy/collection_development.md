Collection Development Policy
=============================

Project Gutenberg is a library of free electronic books (eBooks).  The
Project Gutenberg collection has been built by the efforts of
volunteers who, over many years, have selected and digitized a variety
of written and other works. The collection continues to grow, as new
works are submitted.

## What types of works are eligible?

Project Gutenberg accepts only donations of eBooks (i.e., written
works) that are not currently protected by copyright in the United
States. Such works are in the public domain.  New Project Gutenberg
eBooks are typically digitized versions of books that were published
long ago and for which any US copyright has expired.

Project Gutenberg's collection development focuses on literature and
other written works.  Selections are made by volunteers with diverse
interests, and essentially all eligible submissions are welcome.

The basic eligibility criteria are: 
- Submitted eBooks are digitized
versions of printed books, or similar items such as manuals,
pamphlets, periodicals, travelogues, theses, journals, or chapbooks.
- Evidence is submitted via the copyright portal at
https://copy.pglaf.org to enable Project Gutenberg to confirm the
source - that is, the printed item(s) from which the eBook is 
derived - is in the public domain in the US.
- The eBook is submitted via the
upload portal at https://upload.pglaf.org, and meets the requirements
there for formatting and for proofreading accuracy.  
- The resulting eBook is entirely free of any US
copyrights. Importantly, this includes that the "sweat of the brow"
effort to digitize the source is not an act of authorship, so is not
eligible for copyright; and also that incidental or supplemental
additions, such as transcriber's notes, indices, improvements or
supplements to artwork, or new cover art, are granted permanently to
the public domain.

Some types of items which are ineligible include: 
- Scans of books or other sources that have not been converted to
machine-readable text and undergone proofreading and formatting to the
requirements of the upload portal.
- Unpublished contemporary items, even if they are granted to the
public domain by the author.
- Items that were not previously published or distributed.

## How is a Project Gutenberg eBook related to the source(s) it was based on?

Project Gutenberg eBooks are new works, derived from existing printed
works. Project Gutenberg does not require that its eBooks be exact
representations of their printed sources (i.e., facsimiles). Instead,
the printed works are transformed into modern digital formats. This
process typically includes removing page headers/footers,
de-hyphenation, formatting or relocating footnotes and endnotes,
adding internal links for table of contents and indices, and many
other improvements that are intended to yield an enjoyable reading
experience.

There are strict criteria for file formats and compliance checks,
which are documented in the upload portal, but Project Gutenberg
allows latitude for the volunteers who produce new eBooks to make
choices about how to go about digitization. The producer may make
stylistic choices, such as for page layout or images, whether to
indicate original page numbers from the source, how to handle
footnotes or endnotes, and other aspects of how the printed item is
digitized. Producers are encouraged to focus on presentation of the
content and structure of the eBook, more than a particular visual
presentation or layout. This is because Project Gutenberg eBooks are
intended to be enjoyable, no matter how or where they are read, now
and in the future. As such, production choices should not inhibit
automated or non-automated creation of new derived formats.

## What topics and subject matter are accepted?

The eBooks in the Project Gutenberg collection are freely offered to
readers for their enjoyment, enlightenment, education, and
entertainment. The collection includes eBooks on many topics. There is
emphasis on literary works and reference items of historical
significance, because volunteers have focused on digitizing such
works. Any eligible item, on any topic, is welcome.

Project Gutenberg follows the principles of the American Library
Association's Freedom to Read Statement (FTR), which may be found
online at [www.ala.org](http://www.ala.org/advocacy/intfreedom/freedomreadstatement).

This commitment means that Project Gutenberg does not avoid difficult
or unpopular topics. It also means that Project Gutenberg adds eBooks
to its collection that contain language or ideas that are outdated,
incorrect, offensive, or otherwise inconsistent with today's societal
views, standards or morals.

The FTR relies on the US Constitution's First Amendment right to
freedom of speech and freedom of the press.  Project Gutenberg was
founded on the idea that free, unlimited access to the world's
literature is a pathway to literacy, education, opportunity, and
enlightenment. It is inimical to these principles that the collection,
or access to it, be restricted due to content.

Project Gutenberg's readers and contributors are encouraged to read
the entire FTR document. It presents a vision for how libraries and
publishers, and the people behind them, may work together to "enrich
the quality and diversity of thought and expression."

The FTR makes it clear that inclusion of an item in a library
collection does not mean the ideas within it are endorsed by the
library. "Publishers, librarians, and booksellers do not need to
endorse every idea or presentation they make available. It would
conflict with the public interest for them to establish their own
political, moral, or aesthetic views as a standard for determining
what should be published or circulated."

The final paragraph of FTR nicely summarizes Project Gutenberg's
commitment to building a diverse and vibrant collection, and to not
avoid inclusion of eBooks based on their topics or the ideas within
them: "We state these propositions neither lightly nor as easy
generalizations. We here stake out a lofty claim for the value of the
written word. We do so because we believe that it is possessed of
enormous variety and usefulness, worthy of cherishing and keeping
free. We realize that the application of these propositions may mean
the dissemination of ideas and manners of expression that are
repugnant to many persons. We do not state these propositions in the
comfortable belief that what people read is unimportant. We believe
rather that what people read is deeply important; that ideas can be
dangerous; but that the suppression of ideas is fatal to a democratic
society. Freedom itself is a dangerous way of life, but it is ours."

## Historical context

The Project Gutenberg collection includes a number of items that do
not meet the public domain or formatting criteria described above.
The founder of Project Gutenberg, Michael Hart, invented eBooks in
1971, and the online library grew substantially in the 1980s and
1990s. During that period of time, there were not many free
collections of diverse literary works, and some of the modern
standards we now rely on had not yet emerged (such as Unicode for
representing character sets and HTML for textual markup).

Project Gutenberg worked with many different content types, including
audio books, digitized sheet music, some movies, and quite a few
copyrighted items that were donated by contemporary authors. By the
early 2000s, it was clear that Project Gutenberg was not as
well-suited for those different content types as for public domain
literature. There are now many other outlets for these other types of
works, including a self-publishing portal for contemporary authors
that is operated by a Project Gutenberg affiliate.

Project Gutenberg will not remove or deprecate these previous
items. They were all donated and accepted with the best of intentions,
and with the understanding that Project Gutenberg would provide for
their long-term stewardship and unlimited redistribution. Michael Hart
expressed unending gratitude to all the people who contributed
content, and who digitized previous works. Project Gutenberg remains
grateful to all of its contributors and volunteers.

## Status of this policy

The Project Gutenberg collection development policy was approved by
the Board of Directors of the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation (PGLAF) in November 2019. It was also endorsed by the
Trustees of the Distributed Proofreaders Foundation.

Day-to-day operation of the Project Gutenberg website, along with
associated workflows and procedures, is by volunteers. The specific
mechanisms applied to grow the Project Gutenberg collection are
subject to change over time, within the guidance included in
the collection development policy.
