## Partners
- [Distributed Proofreaders](http://www.pgdp.net). DP allows people to share in the tasks of proofreading, verifying and formatting eBooks for Project Gutenberg.
- [iBiblio](http://www.ibiblio.org/index.html), the public's library. IBiblio is our main eBook distribution site, holds our Web pages, and offers a variety of supporting services.
- [Project Gutenberg Consortia Center (PGCC)](http://www.gutenberg.cc). Collections of collections, with numerous languages and formats. Sponsored by the [World eBook Library](http://www.worldlibrary.net). Host of the [self.gutenberg.org](http://self.gutenberg.org) self-publishing portal.

## Sister Projects

### Project Gutenberg of Australia
[Project Gutenberg of Australia](http://gutenberg.net.au) provides books which are in the public domain in Australia.

As a general rule the works of authors who died before 1955 are in the public domain in Australia.  Works by George Orwell (died 1950), Virginia Woolf (died 1941), and James Joyce (died 1941), just to name a few authors, are in the public domain in Australia.

Of course, works which are in the public domain in Australia may remain copyrighted in other Countries, even for several decades. People may not download, or read online, such works if they are in a country where they are still under copyright. That still leaves a lot of readers out there to enjoy etexts of some of the greatest literary works of the twentieth century.

Project Gutenberg of Australia also provides a list all of the Project Gutenberg etexts (from both the US and Australian Collections) which were written by Australians or which relate (although loosely) to Australia, and has an extensive    collection of books by and about the land and sea explorers who opened up the continent to white settlement.

### Project Gutenberg of Canada
[Project Gutenberg of Canada](http://www.gutenberg.ca) specializes in Canadiana literature in English and French, in the public domain in Canada. [help proofread](http://www.pgdpcanada.net/) through Distributed Proofreaders of Canada.

### Projekt Gutenberg DE
[Projekt Gutenberg-DE](http://www.projekt-gutenberg.org/). German literature. This was the second site to ask Michael Hart to use the Project Gutenberg name and concept, for German-language content. Currently run by a for-profit organization (Hille + Partner GbR), PG-DE provides free eBooks via their Web site, as well as selling eBooks on CD or DVD. For more information about PG-DE, read this German [Wikipedia article](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projekt_Gutenberg-DE). PG-DE runs their own Distributed Proofreaders site for content they distribute, but claims copyright on their work. The content from the central [Distributed Proofreaders](http://www.pgdp.net) does not have such restrictions, and is intended for unlimited redistribution.

### Project Gutenberg Self Publishing Portal
The Project Gutenberg self publishing portal is available at [self.gutenberg.org](http://self.gutenberg.org). It is provided by the Project Gutenberg Consortia Center, and is intended as a highly usable alternative to the main Project Gutenberg site for contemporary authors.  Self-published works are welcome, as are works published previously.

### Projekt Runeberg
[Project Runeberg](http://runeberg.org). Nordic literature. Historically, this was the first site to ask Michael Hart to use a name similar to Project Gutenberg for a sister project.

### ReadingRoo.ms
[ReadingRoo.ms](http://readingroo.ms) emphasizes textual items for unlimited redistribution. This is the home of the [Project Gutenberg PrePrints](https://preprints.readingroo.ms) items not-quite-ready for the main Project Gutenberg collection, available for reading.

## Affiliates

### The Internet Archive
[The Internet Archive](http://www.archive.org). The Internet Archive was our long-time backup distribution site, and for several years our main site.  They are actively working to produce more free eBooks, many of which become part of the Project Gutenberg collection.

### Librivox.org
[Librivox.org](http://librivox.org), a source of human audio eBook performances.  This is Project Gutenberg's main partner for new audio eBooks, and recommended for people who would like to volunteer to do readings.  All Librivox recordings are granted to the public domain, which enables very widespread distribution.  MP3 and other common audio formats are used, so that these may be listened to on computers, mobile devices, and recent CD/DVD players.
