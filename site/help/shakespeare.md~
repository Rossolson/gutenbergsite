Project Gutenberg's Shakespeare Books
-------------------------------------

This page describes Project Gutenberg's multiple versions of the works
of William Shakespeare.


** Project Gutenberg's first Shakespeare in 1994

The works of William Shakespeare have a special role for the Project
Gutenberg collection. Founder Michael Hart's father was a Shakespeare
scholar, and Michael collaborated with his father throughout the 1980s
to digitize the complete works of Shakespeare.

The result was #100, [The Complete Works of William Shakespeare](/ebooks/100).

Since 1994, #100 has been updated many times to provide an HTML file,
to fix typos and other errors, and to be made consistent with the
individual works that were published later by Project Gutenberg as
separate books.


Additional Shakespeare over the years
=====================================

Other Shakespeare versions were added to Project Gutenberg after #100. 
They had different print sources and were digitized by different
volunteers.

By the 2010s, the Project Gutenberg errata team was working on fixing
typos and other errors, ensuring there were HTML versions of all works
(rather than just plain text, as was originally the case), and
that duplicate or near-duplicate files were merged.

In this document, we refer to different document series. Project
Gutenberg assigns a unique accession number to every book. #100 was
the 100th book, for example. 

Groups of Shakespeare books were published by Project Gutenberg over
the years. For simplicity, we refer below to the 1100 series, the 1500
series, the 1700 series, and the 2200 series. You can hover over every
link to see which series it was part of. 

Some titles were maintained over the years such that they are best
grouped with another series, such as Venus and Adonis which, while its
book number is 1045, we group with teh 1500 series.



Where to start for everyday reading enjoyment
=============================================

For readers who want to enjoy Shakespeare, these are probably the best
starting points. They are the #1500 series, along with #1041 and #1045. 

The #1500 series is generally the most complete. It contains Pericles,
The Two Noble Kinsmen, and the five longer poems.  Note that in this
document we present titles in the sorted order including words like
"A" and "The."
