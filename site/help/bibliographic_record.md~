### Format
The file format of the eBook. Main formats are:

HTML ("Read this book online")
: The standard format of the Internet. Use any web browser to display this file format. To save a copy, use your Browser's "Save as.." or similar menu. Be sure to save the "complete" eBook, including images. CSS (cascading style sheets) are usually included within Project Gutenberg HTML files. Occasionally, CSS files are listed separately. HTML may include images in GIF, JPEG, PNG or SVG formats.

Generated HTML
: This HTML was computer-generated because we don't have a hand-crafted HTML version of this ebook. This format may contain formatting errors.

EPUB
: EPUB (electronic publication) is an e-book standard, by the International Digital Publishing Forum (IDPF). EPUB files have the extension <i>.epub</i>. If the eBook contains images, we offer two versions: one with and one without images. Project Gutenberg EPUB files are free from DRM (Digital Restrictions Management). We automatically generate the EPUB files from the HTML file if there is one, else from the plain text file. If the source file is a plain text file, the program must guess at the structure of the text. Thus EPUB files may contain formatting errors like verse lines run together or paragraphs wrongfully marked as headers etc.

Kindle
: "Kindle" means the MOBI format, which is used by the Amazon Kindle series of mobile ebook readers. If the ebook contains images, we offer two versions: one with and one without images.

Plain text
: A text file formatted with a fixed line length. Can be viewed in any browser or with an editor like Windows Notepad. For best results set a monospaced font like Courier. Nearly every ebook is available in plain text format. UTF-8 (a.k.a., Unicode) is almost always available and should work with any modern program. Latin1 (ISO-8859-1), plain vanilla ASCII, and a few other text encodings may also be available.
