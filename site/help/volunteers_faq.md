Volunteers' FAQ
===============

Project Gutenberg welcomes contributions of eBooks from people with
the interest, time, and skillset needed to meet our submission
standards. Details of the process and the standards are at our
copyright clearance site [copy.pglaf.org](https://copy.pglaf.org) and upload site
[upload.pglaf.org](https://upload.pglaf.org).

Join Distributed Proofreaders, Instead
--------------------------------------

For most people interested in producing eBooks, we recommend starting
with Distributed Proofreaders (https://www.pgdp.net).  With
Distributed Proofreaders, you can get involved with different portions
of the production pipeline described below. This is a much easier way
to get started, and results in very high quality eBooks.

If you simply want to suggest a book for digitization, DP has online
forums for this, or you can simply send an email (contact information
is on the site).

Distributed Proofreaders maintains canonical guidance on production.
See especially:

* [The Post-Processing FAQ](https://www.pgdp.net/wiki/DP_Official_Documentation:PP_and_PPV/Post-Processing_FAQ)
* [Easy Epub](https://www.pgdp.net/wiki/DP_Official_Documentation:PP_and_PPV/Easy_Epub). This is a guide to how best to handle the HTML that goes through epubmaker to lead to passable epubs/mobis files.
* [HTML Best Practices](https://www.pgdp.net/wiki/DP_Official_Documentation:PP_and_PPV/DP_HTML_Best_Practices). Examples and explanations of recommended HTML coding practices.

Being a Solo Producer
---------------------

If you might be interested in producing an eBook yourself, without involving
Distributed Proofreaders, here is some guidance. But start with what's above,
including the DP links. 

In a nutshell, the production process typically involves the following:
- Identify a candidate printed book. Confirm it is not already in the
collection, or in process by other volunteers. Use the [Collection 
Development Policy](/policy/collection_development.html) to guide
you on eligibility.
- Obtain scans of the book. This may be done using your own scanner,
or there might be online scans available. Scans
must come from the exact same print edition as your copyright
clearance.
- Obtain a copyright clearance for the printed book. Usually this is
based on scanned title page and verso page demonstrating the printed
book was published more than 95 years ago. See the [Copyright
How-To](/help/copyright.html).
- Perform optical character recognition (OCR) on the scans, to make an
approximate representation of the book in plain text. Depending on the
quality and availability of OCR, you may choose to "type in" all or part
of a text.
- Proofread, proofread, proofread: "Fix" the OCR output by carefully
fixing any errors it made. Remove page headers and 
footers. De-hyphenate. Add back italics or other formatting.
- Format: a text version of your book is almost always required. UTF-8 encoding is preferred.
An HTML version is also required if there are any images present, if only a cover. 
For HTML, generate valid and well-formed HTML source. Different tools
are available for this, and usually involve editing the HTML source
code directly. Note that many tools produce convoluted, non-standard,
or non-valid HTML.  Poor HTML is not accepted, even if it is valid.
Your submitted HTML and text should be ready-to-post as submitted.
- Check, and recheck. The upload site has various tools, including to
test proper conversion to derived formats.
- Upload your work using the copyright clearance key obtained
earlier. The "Preview Submission" capability during upload runs several tests; review
those results before choosing "Submit eBook." 
- A Project Gutenberg production volunteer (known
as a "whitewasher," after the Mark Twain book) will check your upload prior to posting.
Uploads with major problems
(invalid HTML/CSS, non-working or incorrect links, etc.) will be rejected and must be
corrected by the submitter.
- Once the eBook is added to the Project Gutenberg collection, confirm
it is appearing correctly, and all metadata are correct.
- If possible, stay in touch into the future. If we receive errata
reports that require access to source material, or are stylistic or
subjective in nature, we might get in touch to discuss potential
changes.
