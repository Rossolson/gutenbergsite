Subscribe How-To
======================

Visit [lists.pglaf.org](https://lists.pglaf.org/mailman3/lists/?count=50&page=1) to subscribe to the periodic newsletter.

Various mailing lists for Project Gutenberg exist. A brief description of each follows, along with a link to visit or subscribe (or unsubscribe). All lists live at [https://lists.pglaf.org](https://lists.pglaf.org/mailman3/lists/?count=50&page=1), and are moderated except for the discussion lists. If you would like to subscribe to a mailing list simply select a mailing list name below. All lists require email confirmation to subscribe as part of email anti-spam measures. Note that archives from 2006-2009 are not available for some lists, due to a server crash. 

If you only want to report an error in a book or the book catalog then go to [Contact Information](/about/contact_information.html) where the email addresses for that are listed.
