Feeds of New eBooks
===================

Also see the [offline catalogs](/ebooks/offline_catalogs.html) page.

## New Publications Feeds

You can keep updated on new publications in a few different ways.

### Social media

Feeds of new eBooks are updated within an hour or so after publication or update.

*Facebook:* "Like" [gutenberg.new](https://www.facebook.com/gutenberg.new) to have us post new books to your Facebook feed.

*Mastodon:* "Follow" [gutenberg_new](https://mastodon.social/@gutenberg_new") to see postings of new eBooks.

## RSS

Use your favorite RSS reader to load [http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/feeds/today.rss](http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/feeds/today.rss). This includes eBooks posted or updated in the last 24 hours. *Freshness:* Updated nightly.

## Email

Subscribe to the "posted" email list at [lists.pglaf.org](https://lists.pglaf.org). *Freshness:* when a new eBook is uploaded to the servers for processing. It can take up to two hours for a new eBook to be available in the catalog.
